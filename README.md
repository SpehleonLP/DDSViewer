# DDSViewer
Application to view contents of DDS files

Existing programs didn't allow me to view mip layers individually and usually supported a small subset of possible DDS formatted files.

I added as many as i could find a direct mapping for openGL for.  See src/format_table.hpp for the conversion table from the DDS format to GL Format/InternalFormat/Type
